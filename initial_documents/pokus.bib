    abstract = "In the present work, the influence of a minor Hf addition on the atomic structure, crystallization behavior, thermal stability and magnetic properties of a Co-based metallic glass was studied. Thermal analysis indicates that the thermal stability of new glassy ribbons microalloyed with 2.5 at.\\% Hf is notably enhanced through increasing the incubation time prior to devitrification and enlarging the width of the supercooled liquid region from 72 K to 96 K. Magnetic studies reveal that the new glass exhibits an excellent soft magnetic behavior, i.e., a very low coercivity of 0.26 A/m in the relaxed state, and a comparable saturation magnetization as the Hf-free ribbon. Structural relaxation of the Hf-containing alloy upon isothermal annealing below the glass transition temperature, T-g, was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD). The evolution of the recovered enthalpy with annealing time can be expressed by the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) exponential function with a Kohlrausch exponent of 0.88, indicating a broad spectrum of relaxation times. Analysis of the reduced pair correlation functions, G(r), reveals volume shrinkage upon annealing caused by elimination of liquid-like sites including free-volume and anti-free-volume according to the shift in the positions of the G(r) maxima in the medium-range scale. The influence of structural relaxation on the variation of the Curie temperature and the coercivity of the new Hf-microalloyed glassy ribbon is discussed. A faster evolution of the Curie temperature with annealing time compared to the coercivity indicates a preferential dependence of the former on the chemical short-range order (SRO).

The changes of the first maximum in structure factor, S(q), reveal the evolution of atomic structure upon stress. The width of the first maximum in S(q) increases as stress increasing during elastic deformation. After the elastic deformation, the serrated flow occurs, in which the width of the first maximum of S(q) in the loading stage of the serration event also increases. The broadening of the first maximum in S(q) means that the stress induces disordering of the glassy phase, which is because the densely packed clusters is separated into many loosely packed ones. This creates the excess free volumes.",

The hydrogen absorption mechanism was studied by in situ X-ray diffraction at different temperatures and by in situ and ex situ neutron diffraction experiments. The body centered cubic (BCC) metal phase undergoes a phase transformation to a body centered tetragonal (BCT) hydride phase with hydrogen occupying both tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial sites in the structure. Hydrogen cycling of the alloy at 500 degrees C is stable. The large lattice strain in the HEA seems favorable for absorption in both octahedral and tetrahedral sites. HEAs therefore have potential as hydrogen storage materials because of favorable absorption in all interstitial sites within the structure.",

The present study shows a structural change of short-range order induced by an electron-delocalization transition, along with an unusual large-volume shrinkage in Ce-based MGs. An f-electron localization-delocalization transition with thermal hysteresis is observed from the temperature dependence of x-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra, indicating an inheritance of the 4f configuration of pure Ce. However, the delocalization transition becomes broadened due to the local structural heterogeneity and related fluctuation of 4f levels in the Ce-based MGs. The amorphous structure regulated 4f delocalization of Ce leads to bond shortening and abnormal structure change of the topological and chemical short-range orders. Due to the hierarchical bonding nature, the structure should change in a similar manner on different length scales (but not isostructurally like the Ce metal) in Ce-based MGs.",

However, the tau-phase is metastable and it is experimentally difficult to obtain powders suitable for the permanent magnet alignment process, which requires the fine powders to have an appropriate microstructure and high tau-phase purity. In this work, a new method to make high purity tau-phase fine powders is presented. A high purity tau-phase Mn0.55Al0.45C0.02 alloy was synthesized by the drop synthesis method. The drop synthesized material was subjected to cryo milling and followed by a flash heating process. The crystal structure and microstructure of the drop synthesized, cryo milled and flash heated samples were studied by X-ray in situ powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction. Magnetic properties and magnetic structure of the drop synthesized, cryo milled, flash heated samples were characterized by magnetometry and neutron powder diffraction, respectively. The results reveal that the 2 and 4 hours cryo milled and flash heated samples both exhibit high tau-phase purity and micron-sized round particle shapes. Moreover, the flash heated samples display high saturation magnetization as well as increased coercivity.",

Large-scale structural models were generated by fitting the experimental datasets simultaneously in the framework of the reverse Monte Carlo simulation technique. These simulations revealed that As and Te atoms bind to about 3 and 2 As/Te neighbors, respectively, both of which possess Cu neighbors. The Cu Te bond length is 2.57 +/- 0.02 angstrom while the Cu As distance is as high as 2.86 +/- 0.04 angstrom. The results further showed that besides As and Te, Cu atoms also bind to Cu. The total coordination number of Cu is significantly higher than 4 for the compositions x = 25 and 30.",

    abstract = "A well-known feature of the CaFe2As2-based superconductors is the pressure-induced collapsed tetragonal phase that is commonly ascribed to the formation of an interlayer As-As bond. Using detailed x-ray scattering and spectroscopy, we find that Rh-doped Ca0.8Sr0.2Fe2As2 does not undergo a first-order phase transition and that local Fe moments persist despite the formation of interlayer As-As bonds. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe-As bond geometry is critical for stabilizing magnetism and the pressure-induced drop in the c lattice parameter observed in pure CaFe2As2 is mostly due to a constriction within the FeAs planes. The collapsed tetragonal phase emerges when covalent bonding of strongly hybridized Fe 3d and As 4p states completely wins out over their exchange splitting. Thus the collapsed tetragonal phase is properly understood as a strong covalent phase that is fully nonmagnetic with the As-As bond forming as a by-product.",

However, the existence of severe kinetic barriers precludes the occurrence of de/re-hydrogenation processes at such a low temperature (H. Cao, G. Wu, Y. Zhang, Z. Xiong, J. Qiu and P. Chen, J. Mater. Chem. A, 2014, 2, 15816-15822). In this work, Li3N and YCl3 have been chosen as co-additives for this system. These additives increase the hydrogen storage capacity and hasten the de/re-hydrogenation kinetics: a hydrogen uptake of 4.2 wt\\% of H-2 was achieved in only 8 min under isothermal conditions at 180 degrees C and 85 bar of H-2 pressure. The re-hydrogenation temperature, necessary for a complete absorption process, can be lowered below 90 degrees C by increasing the H-2 pressure above 185 bar. Moreover, the results indicate that the hydrogenation capacity and absorption kinetics can be maintained roughly constant over several cycles. Low operating temperatures, together with fast absorption kinetics and good reversibility, make this system a promising on-board hydrogen storage material. The reasons for the improved de/re-hydrogenation properties are thoroughly investigated and discussed.",

    abstract = "Metallic glasses are promising structural materials due to their unique properties. For structural applications and processing the coefficient of thermal expansion is an important design parameter. Here we demonstrate that predictions of the coefficient of thermal expansion for metallic glasses by density functional theory based ab initio calculations are efficient both with respect to time and resources. The coefficient of thermal expansion is predicted by an ab initio based method utilising the Debye-Gruneisen model for a Pd-based metallic glass, which exhibits a pronounced medium range order. The predictions are critically appraised by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and excellent agreement is observed. Through this combined theoretical and experimental research strategy, we show the feasibility to predict the coefficient of thermal expansion from the ground state structure of a metallic glass until the onset of structural changes. Thereby, we provide a method to efficiently probe a potentially vast number of metallic glass alloying combinations regarding thermal expansion.",

The interatomic distance in the first nearest neighbor shell increases with decreasing temperature, while the interatomic distance in other atomic shells decreases. This decrease in the interatomic distances causes volume shrinkage and an increase in the strength of the metallic glass. The volume shrinkage can be quantitatively described by the Varshni function.

By means of several techniques such as simultaneous TG-DTA, FTIR evolved gas analysis, in-situ x-ray diffraction using a synchrotron source and hot-stage microscopy, it was found that all three compounds undergo melting transitions prior to decomposition and that decomposition involves intermediate stages including at least a Ce2O (CnH2n+1CO2)(4) intermediate (n = 3, 4 or 5 for Ce-butanoate, pentanoate or hexanoate respectively). The final decomposition product consists of CeO2, which is formed through a Ce-oxycarbonate. The Ce3+ -> Ce(4+)oxidation seems to proceed via Ce2O3 that first results from the decomposition of the oxycarbonate phase. During the whole decomposition process, the evolved gas species consist of CO2 and symmetrical ketones.",

The synthesized compounds, Li2B12H12 center dot 7NH(3), Na2B12H12 center dot 4NH(3) and CaB12H12 center dot 6NH(3), contain high amounts of NH3, 43.3, 26.6 and 35.9 wt\\% NH3, respectively, which can be released and absorbed reversibly at moderate conditions without decomposition, thereby making the closo-boranes favorable `host' materials for ammonia or indirect hydrogen storage in the solid state. In this work, fifteen new ammine metal dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborane compounds are observed by powder X-ray diffraction, of which six are structurally characterized, Li2B12H12 center dot 4NH(3), Li-2 B12H12 center dot 2NH3, Na2B12H12 center dot 4NH(3), Na2B12H12 center dot 2NH(3), CaB12H12 center dot 4NH(3) and CaB(12)H(12 center dot)3NH(3). Li2B12H12.4NH(3) and Na2B12H12.4NH(3) are isostructural and monoclinic (P2(1)/n) whereas Na2B12H12 center dot 2NH(3) and CaB12H12 center dot 3NH(3) are both trigonal with space groups P3m1 and R3c, respectively. Generally, coordination between the metal and the icosahedral closo-borane anion is diverse and includes point sharing, edge sharing, or face sharing, while coordination of ammonia always occurs via the lone pair on nitrogen to the metal. Furthermore, a liquid intermediate is observed during heating of Li2B12H12 center dot 7NH(3). This work provides deeper insight into the structural, physical, and chemical properties related to thermal decomposition and possible ammonia and hydrogen storage.",

    abstract = "The elastic properties of crystalline metals scale with their valence electron density. Similar observations have been made for metallic glasses. However, for metallic glasses where covalent bonding predominates, such as metalloid metallic glasses, this relationship appears to break down. At present, the reasons for this are not understood. Using high energy x-ray diffraction analysis of melt spun and thin film metallic glasses combined with density functional theory based molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the physical origin of the ultrahigh stiffness in both metalloid and non-metalloid metallic glasses is best understood in terms of the bond energy density. Using the bond energy density as novel materials design criterion for ultra-stiff metallic glasses, we are able to predict a Co33.0Ta3.5B63.5 short range ordered material by density functional theory based molecular dynamics simulations with a high bond energy density of 0.94 eV angstrom(-3) and a bulk modulus of 263 GPa, which is 17\\% greater than the stiffest Co-B based metallic glasses reported in literature.",

    abstract = "Using synchrotron X-ray scattering, we investigate liquid Ge15Te85 spanning a wide temperature range from near T-g to the melt, and demonstrate that the density anomaly and fragile-strong transition are not only related to short-range-order (SRO) structural change (e.g. Peierls-like distortion), but also accompanied by a remarkable development of medium-range-order (MRO). The latter manifests as an emerging pre-peak in total structure factor S(Q) and atomic pair correlations on the length scale of similar to 8 angstrom in the real space G(r) function. The results highlight the role of medium-range structural ordering in the evolution of the configurational entropy which, according to the Adam-Gibbs theory, can be linked to the fragile-strong transition (FS-transition). Based on the relation between structure and liquid dynamics, the FS-transitions at high pressures are examined in terms of experimental data and the Ehrenfest relation. This work identifies the length scale for the atomic correlations in MRO structural evolutions and presents a structural approach to exploring liquid dynamics, which may be useful for investigating relevant phase-change alloys.

Delicate structural changes have been reported to cause ferroelectricity in the magnetically ordered state of CaMn7O12 as well as high-temperature crystallographic transformations. Through high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments we show for the first time the large negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior of the cubic phase of CaMn7O12. A large NTE coefficient alpha(L) for a temperature window of around 60 K is inferred for the cubic phase in the phase coexistence region during the high-temperature structural transition. It is explained using quasirigid unit modes. We also observe a large phase coexistence region of about 100 K across the high-temperature first-order structural transition, which is different from previous reports.",

    abstract = "The doping effect of Sr(OH)(2) on the Mg(NH2)(2)-2LiH system is investigated considering different amounts of added Sr(OH)(2) in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 mol. Experimental results show that both the thermodynamic and the kinetic properties of Mg(NH2)(2)-2LiH are influenced by the presence of Sr(OH)(2). The addition of 0.1 mol Sr(OH)(2) leads to a decrease in both the dehydrogenation onset and peak temperatures of ca. 70 and 13 degrees C, respectively, and an acceleration in the de/re-hydrogenation rates of one time at 150 degrees C compared to Mg(NH2)(2)-2LiH alone. Based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, the overall reaction enthalpy of the 0.1 Sr(OH)(2)-doped sample is calculated to be 44 kJ per mol-H-2 and there are two absorption events occurring in the doped sample instead of one in the pristine sample. For the applied experimental conditions, according to the in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, the reaction mechanism has been finally defined: Sr(OH)(2), Mg(NH2)(2) and LiH react with each other to form SrO, MgO and LiNH2 during ball milling. After heating, SrO interacts with Mg(NH2)(2) producing MgO and Sr(NH2)(2). Then Mg(NH2)(2), LiNH2 and Sr(NH2)(2) react with LiH to produce Li2NH, SrNH, Li2Mg(NH)(2) and Li2Mg2(NH)(3) in traces. After re-hydrogenation, LiSrH3, LiH and LiNH2 are formed along with amorphous Mg(NH2)(2). The reasons for the improved kinetics are: (a) during dehydrogenation, the in situ formation of SrNH appears to increase the interfacial contacts between Mg(NH2)(2) and LiH and also weakens the N-H bond of Mg(NH2)(2); (b) during absorption, the formation of LiSrH3 at around 150 degrees C could be the key factor for improving the hydrogenation properties.",

Recently, there has been a high demand for harder and tougher optical windows that are able to endure severe conditions. Transparent polycrystalline ceramics can fulfill this demand because of their superior mechanical properties. It is known that polycrystalline ceramics with a spinel structure in compositions of MgAl2O4 and aluminum oxynitride (gamma AlON) show high optical transparency. Here we report the synthesis of the hardest transparent spinel ceramic, i.e. polycrystalline cubic silicon nitride (c-Si3N4). This material shows an intrinsic optical transparency over a wide range of wavelengths below its band-gap energy (258 nm) and is categorized as one of the third hardest materials next to diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN). Since the high temperature metastability of c-Si3N4 in air is superior to those of diamond and cBN, the transparent c-Si3N4 ceramic can potentially be used as a window under extremely severe conditions.",

Based on correlative analysis, including synchrotron diffraction experiments and density functional theory, the topology of these amorphous samples is characterised by short metal-oxygen bonds and very pronounced metal-metal interactions within the second coordination shell. We suggest that the role of Nb is within bond length reduction and promotion of quantum confinement, giving rise to an increase in the Seebeck coefficient. Furthermore, these Nb-Ru-O thin films are mechanically flexible as there are no crack formation and delamination upon bending or rolling. This may be rationalised as follows. Nb-Ru-O appears ductile due to low topological connectivity and forms strong bonds with Kapton.",

Upon milling, K-2{[}Zn(NH2)(4)] and 8LiH react to form 4LiNH(2)-4LiH-K2ZnH4, and then 4LiNH(2)-4LiH-K2ZnH4 releases H-2 in multiple steps. The final products of the desorption reaction are KH, LiZn13, and Li2(N)H. During rehydrogenation, KH reacts with LiZn13 under 50 bar of hydrogen producing K3ZnH5. This phase appears to enhance the hydrogenation process which after its formation at ca. 220 degrees C takes place in only 30 s. The system 4LiNH(2)-4LiH-IC2ZnH4 is shown to be reversible under the applied conditions of vacuum at 400 degrees C for desorption and 50 bar of H-2 at 300 degrees C for absorption.",

In this study, In order to better understand the MnAl epsilon ->tau phase transition mechanism in a continuous cooling process and metastable MnAl tau-phase high temperature stability, Mn0.54Al0.46, Mn0.55Al0.45C0.02 and Mn0.55Al0.45B0.02 alloys were systematically studied by in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SR-XRD). The relationship between tau-phase formation tendency and different cooling rates of Mn0.55Al0.45C0.02 was investigated. Besides, the high temperature stabilities of undoped tau-MnAl and carbon/boron doped tau-MnAl were studied. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was also employed to study the phase transformation as well. The research results show that a high cooling rate of 600 degrees C/min leads to a 50/50 wt\\% mixture of epsilon- and tau-phase; almost pure tau-phase was obtained when cooled at a moderate cooling rate of 10 degrees C/min; while for a slow cooling rate of 2 degrees C/min, the tau-phase partially decomposed into beta and gamma(2) phases. No intermediate epsilon'-phase was observed during the epsilon ->tau phase transition during the experiments. For the boron and carbon doped tau-MnAl, the 800 degrees C high temperature stability experiments reveal that C stabilizes the tau-MnAl while doped B destabilises the tetragonal structure and it decomposes into beta- and gamma(2)-phases.

However, the details of the atomic-scale structure, which are responsible for their properties, remain to be clarified. In this study, in-situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction and strain-rate jump compression tests at different cryogenic temperatures were carried out. We show that the activation volume of flow units linearly depends on temperature in the non-serrated flow regime. A plausible atomic deformation mechanism is proposed, considering that the activated flow units mediating the plastic flow originate from the medium-range order and transit to the short-range order with decreasing temperature. {[}GRAPHICS] .",

Stishovite is a high-pressure polymorph of silica and the hardest known oxide at ambient conditions. The grain size of the composites increases with synthesis temperature from similar to 15 to similar to 750nm. The composite is harder than alumina and the hardness increases with reducing grain size down to similar to 80nm following a Hall-Petch relation. The maximum hardness with grain size of 81nm is 23 +/- 1GPa. A softening with reducing grain size was observed below this grain size down to similar to 15nm, which is known as inverse Hall-Petch behavior. The grain size dependence of the hardness might be explained by a composite model with a softer grain-boundary phase.",

The structural rearrangements on the atomic scale during the heating process are analysed as a function of temperature, focusing on shift of the peaks of the structure factor in reciprocal space and the pair distribution function and radial distribution function in real space which are correlated with atomic rearrangements and progressing nanocrystallization. Thermal expansion and contraction of the coordination shells is measured and correlated with the bulk coefficient of thermal expansion. The characteristics of the microstructure and the yield strength of the metallic glass at high temperature are discussed aiming to elucidate the correlation between the atomic arrangement and the mechanical properties.",

    abstract = "Despite the intensive studies for decades, it is still not well understood how qualitatively different magnetic behaviors can occur in a narrow composition range for the Fe-rich Fe-transition metal (TM) amorphous alloys. In this study of amorphous Fe100-xZrx (x = 7, 9, 12) metallic glasses, normal ferromagnetism (FM) is found at 12 \\% Zr where only the FM-paramagnetic (PM) transition is observed at the Curie temperature, TC. In contrast, spin-glass (SG)-PM transition at a temperature, Tg, called SG temperature, is only observed at 7\\% Zr, while in the transient re-entrant composition range (x = 8-11), an SG-FM transition at a temperature, T-f, called spin-freezing temperature, is also observed at low temperature besides the normal FM-PM transition at T-C. In order to understand this unusual behavior, a detailed characterization of pressure (atomic volume), composition, and temperature dependence of the magnetic properties is coupled with high pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction determination of the pressure dependence of the atomic volume. The results on Fe100-xZrx (x = 7, 9, 12) are compared to those obtained for the FM Co91Zr9 metallic glass not showing any kind of anomalous magnetic properties. It is confirmed that the unusual behavior is caused by a granularlike magnetic structure where weakly coupled magnetic clusters are embedded into a FM bulk matrix. Since the mechanism of the magnetization reversal was found to be of the curling type rather than homogeneous rotation, the energy barrier determining the blocking temperature of the clusters is calculated as AR, where A is the exchange constant and R is the cluster size, in contrast to the usual characterization of the energy barrier by KV where K is the anisotropy energy and V is the cluster volume. The volume fraction of the FM part is a fast changing function of the bulk composition: Almost 100\\% FM fraction is found at 12\\% of Zr while no trace of real FM is observed at 7 at \\% Zr. The driving force of this surprising magnetic character is the atomic volume: The lower the Zr content, the higher is the fraction of Fe atoms with compressed atomic volume having low magnetic moment. The percolation of their network separates the clusters from the FM bulk. The complex magnetic behavior of the Fe-rich Fe-Zr amorphous system at low temperatures can thus be interpreted with the only assumption of a cluster-size distribution and a weak coupling of the clusters to the FM matrix. The introduction of this coupling is able to explain the opposite pressure dependence of Tg and Tf. The threshold atomic volume in the low magnetic moment regions is found to be comparable to the atomic volume characteristic to the low-spin limit of the face-centered-cubic Fe alloys. The extensive literature results on the anomalous magnetism for various Fe-rich Fe-TM amorphous alloys and especially for the Fe-rich Fe-Zr glassy system are also found to be in agreement with this granular magnetic behavior.",

    abstract = "An efficient way to study the relationship between chemical composition and mechanical properties of thin films is to utilize the combinatorial approach, where spatially resolved mechanical property measurements are conducted along a concentration gradient. However, for thin film glasses many properties including the mechanical response are affected by chemical topology. Here a novel method is introduced which enables spatially resolved short range order analysis along concentration gradients of combinatorially synthesized metallic glass thin films. For this purpose a CoZrTaB metallic glass film of 3 mu m thickness is deposited on a polyimide foil, which is investigated by high energy X-ray diffraction in transmission mode. Through the correlative chemistry-topology-stiffness investigation, we observe that an increase in metalloid concentration from 26.4 to 32.7 at\\% and the associated formation of localized (hybridized) metal metalloid bonds induce a 10\\% increase in stiffness. Concomitantly, along the same composition gradient, a metalloid -concentration-induced increase in first order metal - metal bond distances of 1\\% is observed, which infers itinerant (metallic) bond weakening. Hence, the metalloid concentration induced increase in hybridized bonding dominates the corresponding weakening of metallic bonds. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = "(Fe75Mo8Cu1B16)-Fe-57 metallic glass prepared by single roller melt spinning was investigated by conversion electron Mssbauer spectroscopy, conversion X-ray Mssbauer spectroscopy and high-energy X-ray diffraction. All methods confirmed presence of amorphous structure without traces of a crystalline phase. Results obtained by Mossbauer spectrometry suggest predominant appearance of magnetic regions on side of the ribbon which was in contact with the quenching wheel. In situ High-energy X-ray diffraction experiment revealed transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state and it was even possible to estimate the Curie temperature.",

The nanostripe patterns are created by the phase separation of LPSO synchronized with chemical concentration. A pressure-temperature phase diagram is given in this research. LPSO is stable below 673 K, the D0(3)+ hcp mixed phase dominant above 973 K under the pressure up to 20 GPa. Phase separation under high pressure is useful for the fabrication of nanostructured metallic materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    abstract = "We present results of a temperature-dependent high-resolution synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction study of sequence of phase transitions in Ni2MnGa. Our results show that the incommensurate martensite phase results from the incommensurate premartensite phase and not from the austenite phase assumed in the adaptive phase model. The premartensite phase transforms to the martensite phase through a first order phase transition with coexistence of the two phases in a broad temperature interval (similar to 40 K), discontinuous change in the unit cell volume as also in the modulation wave vector across the transition temperature, and considerable thermal hysteresis in the characteristic transition temperatures. The temperature variation of the modulation wave vector q shows smooth analytic behavior with no evidence for any devilish plateau corresponding to an intermediate or ground state commensurate lock-in phase. The existence of the incommensurate 7M-like modulated structure down to 5 K suggests that the incommensurate 7M-like modulation is the ground state of Ni2MnGa and not the Bain distorted tetragonal L1(0) phase or any other lock-in phase with a commensurate modulation. These findings can be explained within the framework of the soft phonon model.",

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicate that the synthesized powders exhibit a huge exo-thermic reaction before the crystallization temperature corresponding to structural relaxation of amorphous phase. Furthermore, the structural evolution of the powders upon isochronal heating has been investigated by in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) using high energy synchrotron radiation. The occurrence of an irreversible structural relaxation is confirmed by significant changes in position of the first and second diffuse maxima of the total structure factor S(Q) upon isochronal heating-cooling cycles. Moreover, analysis of the reduced pair distribution functions (PDFs) yields a volume shrinkage of about 1.5\\% after annealing due to annihilation of the excess free volume generated upon milling. The isochronal annealing significantly affects the magnetic properties of the powders through decreasing the saturation magnetization and coercivity. The correlation between structural relaxation and magnetic properties of the powders is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The structural signature of fragility is identified as the temperature dependence of local dilatation on distinct key atomic length scales. A more fragile behavior results from a more pronounced thermally induced dilatation of the structure on a length scale of about 3 to 4 atomic diameters, coupled with shallower temperature dependence of structural changes in the nearest neighbor environment. These findings shed light on the structural origin of viscous slowdown during undercooling of bulk metallic glass-forming liquids and demonstrate the promise of predicting the properties of bulk metallic glasses from the atomic scale structure.

    abstract = "Numerous investigations have demonstrated that the elastic strain in metallic glasses subjected to mechanical loading could be inhomogeneous in the atomic-scale and it increases with distance from an average atom and eventually reaches the macroscopic strain at larger inter-atomic distances. We have observed a similar behavior for the thermal strain imposed by heating of Co40Fe22Ta8B30 glassy particles below the glass transition temperature by analysis of the scattering data obtained by in-situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results imply that the volumetric thermal strains calculated from the shift in position of the principal diffraction maximum and reduced pair correlation function (PDF) peaks are in good agreement for the length scales beyond 0.6 nm, corresponding to the atoms located over the third near-neighbor shell. However, smaller and even negative volumetric thermal strains have been calculated based on the shifts in the positions of the second and first PDF peaks, respectively. The structural changes of Co40Fe22Ta8B30 glassy particles are accompanied by decreasing the average coordination number of the first near-neighbor shell, which manifests the occurrence of local changes in the short-range order upon heating. It is believed that the detected length-scale dependence of the volumetric thermal strain is correlated with the local atomic rearrangements taking place in the topologically unstable regions of the glass governed by variations in the atomic-level stresses.

The effect of Si alloying on thermal stability of the as-deposited amorphous alumina thin films and the phase formation sequence was evaluated by using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. The thermal stability window of the amorphous phase containing 2.7 at.\\% of Si was increased by more than 100 degrees C compared to that of the unalloyed phase. A similar retarding effect of Si alloying was also observed for the alpha-Al2O3 formation temperature, which increased by more than 120 degrees C. While for the latter retardation, the evidence for the presence of SiO2 at the grain boundaries was presented previously, this obviously cannot explain the stability enhancement reported here for the amorphous phase. Based on density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations and synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments for amorphous Al2O3 with and without Si incorporation, we suggest that the experimentally identified enhanced thermal stability of amorphous alumina with addition of Si is due to the formation of shorter and stronger Si-O bonds as compared to Al-O bonds.

It has been shown that the extension of the supercooled liquid region first increases and reaches a large value of 95K and subsequently decreases as a function of Y content. Analysis of the structure factors and pair correlation functions in the reciprocal-space and real-space have indicated that the addition of Y noticeably changes the atomic structure and reduces the degree of the medium-range order. Magnetic measurements have implied that the introduction of Y enhances both saturation magnetization and Curie temperatures of the ribbons, while keeping their coercivity very small. The underlying mechanisms for changes in the atomic structure, improving the thermal stability and magnetic properties upon Y addition have been discussed. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",

To perform the investigation, differential thermal analysis, synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used. In all the investigated alloys structurally complex phases epsilon(n) (epsilon(6) + epsilon(28)) and zeta(b), as well as the delta-phase were identified. Based on the results of differential thermal analysis, sequences of phase transformations were determined. The Al71Pd24Cr4 alloy started to solidify at 1031.4 degrees C through beta. Primary dendrites of zeta(b) were observed in Al73Pd20Cr7 and Al73Pd23Cr4 alloys. In the second step of solidification delta and/or zeta(b) were formed. The peritectic reaction, liquid + zeta(b) + delta -> epsilon(n) + zeta(b) + delta, leading to the formation of the quasicrystalline approximant epsilon(n) (epsilon(6) + epsilon(28)) took place in the final step of solidification at approximately 792 degrees C.

Many metastable phases including amorphous phases have been known, which indicates the presence of large kinetic barriers. As a consequence, some crystalline silica phases transform to amorphous phases by bypassing the liquid via two different pathways. Here we show a new pathway, a fracture-induced amorphization of stishovite that is a high-pressure polymorph. The amorphization accompanies a huge volume expansion of similar to 100\\% and occurs in a thin layer whose thickness from the fracture surface is several tens of nanometers. Amorphous silica materials that look like strings or worms were observed on the fracture surfaces. The amount of amorphous silica near the fracture surfaces is positively correlated with indentation fracture toughness. This result indicates that the fracture-induced amorphization causes toughening of stishovite polycrystals. The fracture-induced solid-state amorphization may provide a potential platform for toughening in ceramics.",

In the investigation, scanning electron microscopy including energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy using high-angle annular dark-field detector were used. The as-cast sample was found to be heterogeneous from both structural and metal composition points of view. Based on experimental results phason models and cluster arrangements of epsilon(6), epsilon(16) and epsilon(28) phases were proposed. The near-equilibrium at 700 degrees C long-term annealed sample was found to consist of epsilon(16) only; it exhibited the structural and chemical homogeneity. The attention was also paid on the comparison of experimentally determined and modelled structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The changes in position, intensity, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the first and second diffuse maxima of the XRD patterns suggest the occurrence of irreversible structural relaxation upon the first heating up to a temperature close to the glass transition temperature T-g. The variations in reduced pair correlation functions upon annealing are discussed in the frame of the topological fluctuation theory for structural relaxation. Isochronal annealing of the Co40Fe22Ta8B30 glassy particles improves their soft magnetic properties through decreasing the coercivity and increasing the magnetic susceptibility, saturation magnetization, and Curie temperature.

    abstract = "In the present work we have focused on the preparation and magnetic study of coordination polymer formed by Gd(III) cations as nodes and formate (HCOO-; FOR) anions as charge compensating linkers. The prepared complex with formula [Gd(mu(3)-FOR)(3)](n) was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and high-energy powder X-ray diffraction. The structural study showed that complex is formed by 3D polymeric network with the shortest Gd-Gd, distances of 3.998 angstrom. The magnetic properties of the complex were studied by magnetic susceptibility chi(M)(T) and magnetization M(H) measurements. The results show on the weak antiferromagnetic coupling at low temperatures represented by the Weiss constant theta = -0.468 K. The value of effective magnetic moment mu(eff) = 7.57 mu(B), which was estimated from the experimental data is close to the theoretical value for systems with S = 7/2. Correlation between crystal structure of complexes and magnetic properties is presented.",

After 14 h of milling, the obtained powders were found to consist mainly of an amorphous phase and a small fraction of the (Co,Fe)(21)Ta(2)B(6)nanocrystals. The changes in the reduced pair correlation functions suggest noticeable changes in the atomic structure of the amorphous upon ball milling. Furthermore, it has been shown that milling is accompanied by introduction of compressive and dilatational sites in the glassy phase and increasing the fluctuation of the atomic-level hydrostatic stress without affecting the coordination number of the nearest neighbors. Ball milling has decreased the thermal stability and significantly affected the magnetic properties through increasing the saturation magnetization, Curie temperature of the amorphous phase and coercivity.

The compounds obtained in this way crystallize in the cubic fluorite structure in the range from 0 <= x less than or similar to 0.775 which extends the range for the fluorite-type Ba1-xLaxF2+x covered up to now (0 <= x <= 0.55) considerably. By employing F-19 NMR spectroscopy and X-ray (total) scattering, indications for a continuous change from the fluorite (BaF2) to the tysonite structure (LaF3) were found. The mechanosynthesized samples showed slightly higher fluoride ion conductivities for the samples with x <= 0.40 and clearly smaller conductivities in the case of the samples with x >= 0.85 than reported for their monocrystalline counterparts. Two conductivity maxima at x approximate to 0.40 and x approximate to 0.85 and a conductivity minimum at x approximate to 0.75 were observed for the mechanosynthesized Ba1-xLaxF2+x. For the samples with 0.10 <= x <= 0.50, exhibiting a dc conductivity in the order of 10(-5) S/cm at 400 K, all fluoride ions seem to be highly mobile at temperatures beyond 453 K. The decrease of the ionic conductivity observed for Ba1-xLaxF2+x, with increasing x in the range from x approximate to 0.50 to x approximate to 0.75 is accompanied by a change of the diffusion behavior and a decrease of the ratio of highly mobile to nonmobile or slow fluoride ions.",

For that, the whole powder pattern modeling approach (WPPM) was used to analyze the evolution of microstructural features including coherently scattering domain size, dislocation density, and density of planar faults. It was found that for all sets of experiments, structural decomposition is the dominant mechanism of nanostructure formation during cryomilling. During subsequent RT-milling, grain refinement still occurs by structural decomposition for pure copper. On the other hand, discontinuous dynamic recrystallization is responsible for nanostructure formation during RT-milling of Cu-3wt\\% Zn. This is attributed to lower stacking-fault energy of Cu-3wt\\% Zn compared to pure copper. Finally, room temperature milling reveals the occurrence of a detwinning phenomenon. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

In the investigation the synchrotron X-ray diffraction and the high-resolution scanning electron microscopy inclusive of the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used. In all the investigated conditions beta-(Ni,Pd)Al (Pm3m) and Al-3(NiPd)(2) (P3m1) phases were identified. After 2650 h of annealing the former phase was found to be separated into two isostructural modifications differing from one another in Pd- and Ni-contents. The annealing for 455 h contributed to the decrease of lattice parameters in the Al3NiPd phase compared to the original as-cast condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Influence of crystallization and/or phase separation on these properties is described. Temperature dependences of the dc conductivity are Arrhenius-like; their conduction activation energy increases (0.73-0.84 eV) and the dc conductivity decreases (1.5 x 10 (6) - 8 x 10 (8) S/m, at 60 degrees C) with decreasing concentration of Te. Doping with Ho3+ ions in a metallic form decreases the conduction activation energy. Relative static permittivity of glasses ranges from 9.6 to 12.8. The highest values are found in heavily doped, partly crystallized glasses. The lowest values are found in ``pure'' glasses with a high content of Te. At 1000 wt.-ppm Ho, modular diagrams are almost semicircular, modular spectra are Debye-like, and their shape is independent on temperature. At 2000 wt.-ppm Ho, two relaxation processes appear and the shape of both modular diagrams and modular spectra depend on temperature. A partial crystallization takes place in these glasses. For heavily doped glasses (1500 and 2000 wt.-ppm Ho), XRD experiments, using high-energy photons, show distinct Bragg peaks stemming from a tiny fraction (about 0.25\\%) of crystalline phases. Crystalline component is rather homogeneously distributed within the sample. Changing level of Ho doping affects the short-distance arrangement in glasses. A higher level of Ho doping implies shortening of the inter-atomic distances, higher mean atomic density, and higher coordination numbers what suggests better atomic packing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The monolithic samples with 1 mm diameter revealed a fracture strain of 3.80\\% and a maximum stress of 4143 MPa upon compression, together with a slight work-hardening behavior. SEM micrographs of fractured samples did neither reveal any shear bands on the lateral surface nor the typical vein patterns which characterize ductile fracture. However, some layers appear to have flowed and this phenomenon took place before the brittle final fracture. An estimate of the temperature rise Delta T in the shear plane gives 1039 K, which is large enough to melt a layer of 120 nm. The overall performance and the macroscopic plastic strain depend on the interaction between cleavage-like and viscous flow-like features. Mechanical tests performed in-situ under synchrotron radiation allowed the calculation of the strain tensor components, using the reciprocal-space data and analyzing the shift of the first (the main) and the second broad peak positions in the X-ray diffraction patterns. The results revealed that each atomic shell may have a different stiffness, which may explain the macroscopic compressive plastic deformation. Also, there were no signs of (nano) crystallization induced by the applied stress, but the samples preserve a monolithic amorphous structure until catastrophic failure occurs.

We discover a close correlation between the atomic structure evolution and the strength of the BMG and find out that the activation energy increment of the concordantly atomic shifting at lower temperature is the main factor influencing the strength. Our results might provide a fundamental understanding of the atomic-scale structure evolution and may bridge the gap between the atomic-scale physics and the macro-scale fracture strength for BMGs.",

The characterization of the samples was carried out by N-2 adsorption/desorption, Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), High-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) and HRTEM measurements. The magnetic properties of the prepared nanocomposites were investigated by the SQUID magnetometry. It was shown, that in spite of its non-magnetic nature the silica matrix significantly influences the magnetism of the samples. The magnetic properties are strongly affected by the strength of inter-particle interactions and dimensionality of the porous matrix. Weak dipolar interactions between superparamagnetic (SPM) hematite nanoparticles were observed in the nanocomposite with hexagonally ordered silica channels (alpha-Fe2O3@SBA-15), while the strong interactions between hematite nanoparticles, suggesting the superspin glass behavior (SSG), were observed in the nanocomposite with silica matrix of cubic symmetry (alpha-Fe2O3@SBA-16).

    abstract = "Nickel-base alloys are used in high-temperature applications whenever steels or titanium alloys cannot be applied anymore. This class of alloys is furthermore used in low-temperature applications in the oil or gas industry in case the corrosion resistance of stainless steels in related liquid media is not sufficient and titanium alloys would be too expensive. Nickel-base alloys, however, due to their high strength and toughness can be machined only at low cutting speeds as otherwise poor surface quality and enhanced tool wear is observed. From all aspects influencing the machinability, the chip formation mechanism is the key factor and only a thorough understanding of this mechanism can lead to an optimisation of the cutting process. In the current study, a detailed microstructure and phase analysis of Alloy 625 chips produced in an orthogonal cutting process at conventional cutting speeds is presented. Utilising hard monochromatic X-rays focused down to micrometre size, microstructural differences between distinct structural units of the chips, namely, the segments and shear bands, are investigated. Scanning cross sections of the chips with this small beam allowed us to determine misorientation between the segments and shear bands crystal lattices which as we found are not changing abruptly but continuously, with an absolute difference up to 10 degrees.

Furthermore, our investigations were corroborated by ab initio theoretical studies. The perovskite symmetry, Pm (3) over barm, is unstable at the M- and R-points of the Brillouin zone. The lattice instabilities are lifted when the structure relaxes in one of the symmetries: I4/mcm, Imma, R (3) over barc with relative relaxation energy around -25 meV. Intimate phase analysis confirmed phase purity of our ceramics. A prominent peak in the Eu specific density of phonon states at 11.5 meV can be modeled in all candidate symmetries. A stiffening on heating around room temperature is indicative of a phase transition similar to the one observed in SrTiO3, however, although previous studies reported the structural phase transition to the tetragonal I4/mcm phase our detailed sample purity analysis and thorough structural studies using complementary techniques did not confirm a direct phase transition. Instead, in the same temperature range, Eu delocalization is observed which might explain the lattice dynamical instabilities.",

No high or low temperature crystal structure information is known on this phase. Therefore high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction measurements have been done on a synthetic sample of Sr-fresnoite in the temperature range 87-1223K. This was done as a test experiment using the HRPD beamline P02.1 at PETRA-III, DESY. Synchrotron X-ray wavelengths of 0.2067(3)angstrom (293K and 573-1223K) and 0.2079(3)angstrom (87-499K) were used. Powder diffraction data were collected with a counting time of 30s using a PerkinElmer XRD 1621 flat panel image plate detector. CeO2 was included as an internal standard to calibrate the sample to detector distance. The P4bm tetragonal crystal structure of fresnoite (Ba2TiSi2O8) was used as a starting model for Sr-fresnoite. Small amounts of SrTiO3 and SrSiO3 were also found as impurities in this sample; therefore four-phase Rietveld refinements were done. The P4bm fresnoite structure is retained over the temperature range 87-1223K.",

Based on pair distribution functions and Voronoi tessellation, the icosahedral bonding is expected. A rather large Young's modulus of 365 GPa is predicted for amorphous AlYB14. To verify these predictions, we have measured density, pair distribution functions, binding energy and elastic properties of Al-Y-B thin films synthesized by magnetron sputtering. The calculated and measured densities are with a deviation of 3.5\\% in good agreement. The measured binding energy and pair distribution functions are also consistent with icosahedral bonding. The measured Young's modulus is 305 +/- 19 GPa, which is 16\\% smaller than the theoretical value and hence in good agreement. Overall consistency between theory and experiments was obtained indicating that the computational strategy employed here is useful to describe correlations between bonding, elasticity, density as well as (chemical) short range order and may hence enable future knowledge-based design of these ternary borides which show great potential for surface protection applications.

In addition, in situ high-pressure (up to 40 GPa) x-ray diffraction was performed to determine the compressibility of the latter two alloys. Both the Curie temperature T-C (at atmospheric pressure T-C = 201 +/- 3 and 159 +/- 3 K) and the low-temperature saturation magnetization M-5 K,M- (5 T) decrease remarkably with increasing pressure: dT(C)/dp = -31 +/- 0.5 and -32.5 K GPa(-1) and d ln M-5 K,M- 5 T/dp = -015 +/- 0.02 and -0.13 +/- 0.03 GPa(-1) for chi(Mn) = 20 and 24 at.\\%, respectively. Compared to d ln M-5 K,M- 5 T/dp = 0.016 +/- 0.003 GPa(-1) measured for Fe75B25, the pressure dependence of M-5 K,M- 5 T is one order of magnitude larger in the ternary alloys. The bulk moduli for the Fe56Mn24B20 and Fe75B25 glasses were measured to be 152 GPa and 173 GPa, respectively. These data are also compared with the pressure dependence of the hyperfine field and theoretical calculations of the saturation moment for Fe-B alloys reported in the literature. The results were interpreted within an inhomogeneous itinerant-electron model of ferromagnetism.",

    abstract = "Polymorphic phase transitions are common in crystalline solids. Recent studies suggest that phase transitions may also exist between two liquid forms with different entropy and structure. Such a liquid-liquid transition has been investigated in various substances including water, Al2O3-Y2O3 and network glass formers. However, the nature of liquid-liquid transition is debated due to experimental difficulties in avoiding crystallization and/or measuring at high temperatures/pressures. Here we report the thermodynamic and structural evidence of a temperature-induced weak first-order liquid-liquid transition in a bulk metallic glass-forming system Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 characterized by non- (or weak) directional bonds. Our experimental results suggest that the local structural changes during the transition induce the drastic viscosity changes without a detectable density anomaly. These changes are correlated with a heat capacity maximum in the liquid. Our findings support the hypothesis that the `strong' kinetics (low fragility) of a liquid may arise from an underlying lambda transition above its glass transition.",

Monotonic changes are observed in the diffraction data without any indication of a phase transition. In real space all maxima of the atomic pair correlation function including the nearest neighbour distance are decreasing and scale with pressure. The volume as function of hydrostatic pressure is extracted from the diffraction data. For the largest hydrostatic pressure of 47.4 GPa the volume is reduced by 18\\%. The bulk modulus B-0 = 178 GPa was calculated from the diffraction data. The dependence of volume on pressure of Pd40Cu30Ni10P20 metallic glass can be well described by the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The phase transformation and equilibria in the liquid phase were studied in situ for two alloys, Co30Gd35Ti35 and Co30Gd50Ti20, by combining electrostatic levitation of the samples with high-energy synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) at elevated temperature. The XRD patterns with two diffuse maxima for molten Co30Gd35Ti35 give direct evidence for liquid-liquid phase separation in this composition. In contrast, no indication for phase separation in the Co30Gd50Ti20 alloy is detected. Coarsened microstructures, typical for the phase-separating systems, are observed for the Co30Gd35Ti35, Co25Gd37.5Ti37.5, Co10Gd45Ti45 and Co30Gd20Ti50 cast alloys. Our findings suggest that the stable miscibility gap of binary Gd-Ti extends into the ternary Co-Gd-Ti system (up to about 30 at.\\% Co). Thermodynamic calculations of the ternary Co-Gd-Ti system by the CALPHAD method are in good agreement with the experimental results.",

Their structure was investigated by x-ray diffraction and extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements. Experimental datasets were fitted simultaneously by the reverse Monte Carlo simulation technique. It is concluded that Te is mostly twofold coordinated and the majority of Ge atoms have four neighbours. The number of Ge-Ge and Te-Te bonds evolves monotonically with composition. Ge-Ge bonding can be observed already at x = 24 while Te-Te bonds can be found even in Ge44.6Te55.4. The models obtained by simulation show that the structure of compositions with x > 24 should be considered as a random covalent network but there is chemical ordering for x <= 24, exactly in the composition range where glasses can be obtained from the melt by fast quenching. The composition dependences of some physical properties also point to the connection between chemical short range order and the stability of the amorphous phase: while the glass transition temperature and microhardness increase monotonically with the composition, the thermal stability of the amorphous films goes through a maximum around x = 20-24.",

The new alloy as a good soft magnetic material showed a very low coercivity of 0.8 A/m and polarization of 0.5 T. The origin of high thermal stability was attributed to the formation of Ta-Ta bonds in the microstructure and the absence or very low quantity of Ta-based units with the composition close to the stoichiometry of the (Co,Fe)(21)Ta2B6 crystalline phase.

The open volume almost keeps constant during homogeneous deformation, suggesting that a high content of open volume is a key point for developing BMGs with pronounced tensile plasticity.

We show that ultrasonic measurements at a frequency of around 10(5) Hz detect both critical phenomena close to TC and intrinsic magnetomechanical damping in the ferromagnetic state. However, the values of absorption and Young's modulus anomaly observed over the critical range are quite low and do not permit reliable analysis of the critical exponents.

The ordering of structure and the growth of nanocrystallites upon annealing was estimated independently from XRD patterns, PDF functions and SAXS scattering curves. Neither transition to pyrochlore phase, nor signs of recently shown in related Gd2O3-HfO2 compounds pyrochlore-type superstructure is observed.

We found that the ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition of the amorphous phase is revealed as a change in the slope of the thermal expansion curve when heating a sample at a constant rate up to 520 degrees C. Real space analysis by means of the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) demonstrated that the rate and extent of the thermal expansion strongly depend on the interatomic separation. The PDF proved to be a reliable method for the description of crystallization kinetics. Further it allows determination of sizes of ultrafine nanocrystals with grain sizes well below 8 nm and thus makes observation of early stages of nanocrystallization possible. Following grain growth kinetics during isothermal annealing at 500 and 520 degrees C we found that the activation energy of the process is 357 +/- 12 kJ mol(-1).",

In this work, in situ high energy X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out during the SHS process and the mechanism of the intermetallic' formation in FeAl25 powder mixture was described during rapid heating and isothermal annealing at 800 degrees C as well as during a slower continuous heating to 900 degrees C. During slower heating, the formation of Fe2Al5 and FeAl2 intermetallics starts below the melting point of aluminium. When the heating rate is high, intermetallics are created after melting of aluminium. During long-term annealing, all of the phases can be transformed to FeAl phase when fine powders were applied. Detailed mechanism is proposed in this paper and kinetics of the intermetallics' formation is described. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

While it is widely assumed in literature that the good glass-forming ability of Zr-Cu is related to an icosahedral short-range order prevailing in the melt, our partial structure factors demonstrate that the liquid Zr-Cu is not characterized by a dominant icosahedral short-range order.

Analysing diffraction patterns in reciprocal space by tracing the position of the first sharp diffraction peak provided information about the thermal expansion behaviour on atomic scale. Two distinct zones showing different slopes were identified for all expansion curves in the temperature range between 40 and 450 degrees C. The temperatures at which the expansion curves change their slopes are in good accordance with the Curie temperatures determined from thermomagnetic curves. Therefore, it is concluded that the in situ high-energy x-ray diffraction enables detection of the transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state in the case of Fe-based metallic glasses.",

Short range order, charge transfer and the bonding nature are analyzed by means of density of states, Bader decomposition and pair distribution function analysis. A clear trend of a decrease in density and bulk modulus as well as a weaker cohesion was observed as the valence electron concentration is increased by replacing B with Si and further with P and S. These changes may be understood based on increased interatomic distances, variations in coordination numbers and the electronic structure changes; as the valence electron concentration of X is increased the X bonding becomes more ionic, which disrupts the overall metallic interactions, leading to lower cohesion and stiffness. The highest magnetic moments for the transition metals are identified for X D S, despite the fact that the presence of X generally reduces the magnetic moment of Co. Furthermore, this study reveals an extended diagonal relationship between B and P within these amorphous alloys. Based on quantum mechanical data we identify composition induced changes in short range order, charge transfer and bonding nature and link them to density, elasticity and magnetism.

Samples were bent using two different benders with radii of 10 and 20 mm. The components of the strain tensor were determined from the change of positions of the first maximum of the diffracted intensity in reciprocal space. The procedure of data treatment was improved by the introduction of direct beam off-center correction. Comparing results for the two different bending radii, we found that the zero stress region does not necessarily lay within the central part of the specimen. Bending with smaller radius resulted in symmetric strain distribution, whereas a larger bending radius revealed strong asymmetry. Furthermore, bending with a smaller radius (10 mm) shows steeper strain gradients as compared with the situation in which the larger bending radius (20 mm) was used. Using a smaller bending radius implies reaching higher tensile/compressive stresses and reveals the signs of the plastic deformation, which are demonstrated as a saturation of elastic strains.",

    abstract = "Tremendous research effort has been put into the study of plastic deformation mechanisms of metallic glasses (MGs) in an attempt to elucidate the origin of their high fracture strength. Little attention has, however, been paid to the elastic deformation of MGs. In this paper, a series of MGs with different yield strengths are studied, with a focus on the fine structural evolution (at the atomic level) during elastic deformation. Our results reveal that an atomic reorientation happens in the first nearest-neighbor shell due to elastic deformation. This reorientation subsequently leads to a drop in the local stress, which further results in a cooperative shift of surrounding atoms to counterbalance this change in local stress level. A concordant region is formed as a result. The relation between this concordant region and the yield strength is thoroughly discussed in terms of its size and the stress level in this region. It is proposed that this concordant region could be the missing part that bridges the macroscopic yield strength and the microscopic atomic structure. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

    abstract = "Fe-Al alloys have been known for more than 100 years. Their exceptional oxidation and sulphidation resistance makes them promising for many industrial applications. However, these materials suffer from poor room-temperature ductility and problems during a production by conventional melting metallurgy. Therefore, reactive sintering of iron and aluminium compressed powder mixtures have been proposed as the alternative technology of their production. Unfortunately, this production technology leads to highly porous products. There are many theories why the porosity is so high and all of them deal with the intermetallic phases' formation mechanisms. There are at least three different phases' formation sequences during heating described in the literature. In this work, the in situ high energy X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out during the reactive sintering process and the mechanism of the formation of intermetallics in FeAl25 powder mixture was described during isothermal annealing at 800 degrees C as well as during a slow continuous heating to this temperature. In both cases, no phases are formed prior the melting of aluminium particles. After that, Fe2Al5 and FeAl phases arise. The effect of the intermetallics' formation on the porosity of Fe-Al alloys is discussed.",

    abstract = "Reactive sintering is suitable method for preparing of intermetallic alloys. However, binary Al-Fe alloys prepared by this processing method are highly porous. This problem can be successfully solved by alloying these alloys by other element such as Si and Ni. The effect of these elements is not only in formation of completely new phases containing alloying elements. The Al-Fe-Si alloy and mainly the Al-Fe-Si-Ni alloy exhibit significantly higher thermal evolution during the reactive sintering process. This can lead to partially melting of forming intermetallic phases and consequent decrease of porosity. By this effect, it is not possible completely explain the differences in properties of alloyed and binary alloys. For detail description of alloying elements effect, it is necessary to observe phase composition during the process of reactive sintering and not only at the beginning and at the end as it is usual. The in-situ diffraction of high energy X-ray beam was used to study formation of intermetallics phases during reactive sintering process of Al-Fe, Al-Fe-Si and Al-Fe-Si-Ni alloys. The additional changes in reaction mechanism caused by alloying elements were described, such as lower melting temperature of reaction mixture components and effect of silicon on ferrite stabilization. Based on this information, it is possible to explain significant decrease of porosity of ternary and quaternary alloys in comparison to binary Al-Fe alloy.",

The precursors consisted of Fe, Se and Te or Se0.5Te0.5 powder mixtures and were encased in a metal (Cu/Nb) composite sheath to prevent evaporation of Se and Te during high temperature processing. In all cases (Fe - Se - Te ternary mixture; Fe - Se0.5Te0.5 binary mixtures with two different Fe particle sizes) the ternary alloy forms via Fe(Se,Te)(2) and Fe-3(Se,Te)(4) intermediate phases. When unreacted Se and Te powders are used in the precursor, partial Se1-xTex alloying takes place during heating prior and during the formation of the intermediate phases. As the alloying is incomplete, the resulting Fe(Se, Te) phase is not homogeneous. Using pre-alloyed Se0.5Te0.5 allows a better control of the reaction although homogeneisation also occurs in the Fe(Se, Te) phase as a consequence of the phase equilibria of the Se - Te system. The grain size of the starting Fe powder has no influence on the reaction path for the grain sizes used in the present study. However, the reaction rate for Fe(Se, Te) formation is clearly sensitive to this parameter. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B. V.

    abstract = "Growth, texture evolution and microstructure dependency of solution derived Gd2Zr2O7 films deposited on textured Ni-5 at.\\%'W substrates have been extensively studied. Influence of processing parameters, in particular annealing temperature and dwell time, as well as thickness effect on film texture and morphology are investigated in details. It is found that a rotated cube-on-cube epitaxy of Gd2Zr2O7 < 110 >//NiW < 100 > in-plane texture forms as soon as the (004) out-plane texture appears, implying that epitaxial growth dominates the crystallization processes. Thermal energy plays an important role in minimizing the difference of interfacial energy along two directions in the anisotropic metallic substrate. Growth of Gd2Zr2O7 films displays an ultrafast kinetics under optimized conditions. Independency of sharp epitaxial (004) and polycrystalline (222) orientation is revealed from further synchrotron diffraction studies. Fully covered films with a broad thickness range exhibit a high degree of biaxial orientation, similar surface morphology with crack free and nano-size grains microstructure, seemingly independent of neither heat treatment nor thickness. Particularly, we compared the porosity of the film surface and body according to surface or cross-sectional observation and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry analysis, pointing to inhomogeneous structure through film thickness, i.e., dense in the surface layer but porous in the body. This is attributed to trapped gas generated during either decomposition or crystallization in the thicker films. This work not only demonstrates a route for producing textured Gd2Zr2O7 buffer layers with dense structure directly on technical substrates, but also provides some fundamental understandings related to chemical solution derived films grown on metallic substrates.

The computationally obtained density of 8.19 g cm(-3) for Co43Fe20Ta5.5B31.5 and 8.42 g cm(-3) for Co45.5Fe24Ta6B24.5, as well as the Young's moduli of 273 and 251 GPa, respectively, are consistent with our experiments and literature data. These data, together with the good agreement between the theoretical and the experimental pair distribution functions, indicate that the model established here is useful to describe the density, elasticity and short range order of Co-Fe-Ta-B metallic glass thin films. Irrespective of the investigated variation in chemical composition, (Co, Fe)-B cluster formation and Co-Fe interactions are identified by density-of-states analysis. Strong bonds within the structural units and between the metallic species may give rise to the comparatively large stiffness.",

It is found that the CLO crystallites forms excellent in-plane texture as soon as the phase appears at 860 degrees C, indicating that interfacial nucleation dominates at the beginning of the amorphous-crystallization transition. Grain growth is almost complete after at 900 degrees C for 15 min. Analysis of the isothermal process of crystallization at 900 degrees C by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov equation shows that grain development is mainly controlled by diffusion. The success of this work demonstrates the possibility of studying crystallization behaviors of solution derived films using a non-destructive method, which has the potential of being applicable to most types of thin film samples.

During a 2 A degrees C/min heating ramp, Te first reacts between 200 and 350 A degrees C with a part of the Fe powder to form FeTe(2), which then further reacts between 350 and 530 A degrees C with the remaining Fe to yield FeTe.

Analyzing series of two-dimensional XRD patterns in reciprocal space yields strain tensor components of the amorphous alloy providing insight about its deformation mechanisms. Comparing tensile tests performed at different temperatures indicates that the deformation mechanism gradually changes from purely elastic to completely plastic regime. The Poisson ratio nu of the investigated alloy increases with increasing deformation temperature however the fracture strength sigma(f) shows opposite behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

    abstract = "An optimized buffer layer architecture prepared by a metal organic deposition method on biaxially textured metallic substrate is proposed and developed successfully. The major achievement of this work is to choose a Ce0.9La0.1O2 layer as cap layer that possesses an excellent lattice match with the superconductor layer, and to employ 200 nm thick Gd2Zr2O7 film as barrier layer. The effect of thermal cycling on the texture and morphology of the crystallized films and NiW substrate is discussed in detail. The texture quality and the epitaxial relationship between the buffer layer stack and the metallic substrate were studied by synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Well textured, smooth and crack-free Ce0.9La0.1O2/Gd2Zr2O7 buffer layer stacks are obtained, demonstrating the possibility of producing a high quality buffer layer stack by a low cost chemical solution deposition route.",

Experimental datasets have been fitted simultaneously by the reverse Monte Carlo simulation technique. It has been found that all components obey the 8-N rule. Se binds preferentially to Ge. At x = 20, experimental data can be fitted without Se-Te bonding, but Se-Se bonds appear, and the Te-Te coordination number starts to increase. These observations show that though Se and Te are completely miscible in the liquid and in the solid phases the presence of Ge induces nanoscale phase separation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that Co increases the thermal stability, as well as the Curie temperature, which monotonously increases as the Co content increases. The saturation magnetization shows a maximum of 1.01 mu(B) per magnetic atom for x=0.1, followed by a perfectly linear decrease for higher Co contents. The extension of the supercooled liquid region may reach even 98 K and the glass transition temperatures approach the theoretical value of 2/3 of the melting temperature. The mean field theory allows to calculate the magnetic exchange stiffness constant and to correlate its variation with the variation of the magnetic saturation.

The final structural model was analysed by means of partial pair correlation functions, coordination number distributions and Voronoi tessellation. In our study we found that the most probable atomic separations between Al-Al and U-Al pairs in the glassy Al92U8 alloy are 2.7 angstrom and 3.1 angstrom with coordination numbers 11.7 and 17.1, respectively. The Voronoi analysis did not support evidence of the existence of well-defined building blocks directly embedded in the amorphous matrix. The dense-random-packing model seems to be adequate for describing the connection between solvent and solute atoms.",

The ``double-yielding{''} platforms of this alloy are indeed due to a low stress yielding (similar to 400 MPa) followed with a significant work-hardening before necking and fracture. In this process, the {[}0 2 2] orientation of grains more approaches the tensile direction and the {[}2 0 0] moves to the transverse, causing the lattice parameter a to be shrunk, and b and c elongated, and the formation of texture. The similar texture can also be produced upon cold rolling by which the yield strength of the alpha `' phase is largely improved to be over 900 MPa. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In order to elucidate the deformation mechanism and to increase the ductility of BMGs, the local variations in structure and/or composition play an important role. Such kind of structural modification can be induced by annealing at temperatures slightly below the glass transition temperature T-g. The present work deals with two well-known Zr-based BMGs: Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 and Zr55Cu20Al10Ni10Ti5. Both BMGs show increased ductility after annealing, but the microstructural modifications are different. (c) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.",

Constant-rate heating experiments using a fast X-ray camera (time resolution of 3 s) reveal detailed information about the thermal stability of the La-based BMG. Analyzing diffraction patterns in a reciprocal space yields thermal expansion of amorphous alloy providing insight about the thermally activated relaxation effects and glass transition. We found that in the region 20K below the glass transition (T-g = 420 K) thermal expansion curve exhibits negative slope which indicates annealing-out of the quenched-in free volumes. The glass transition appears as a brake in the value of coefficient of the volume thermal expansion. alpha(th). Furthermore, real space analysis based on reduced pair distribution function G(r) allows to trace the changes in the local atomic structure of amorphous material during constant-rate heating.

By using tapes in superconducting coils the anisotropic behaviour of the critical current, i.e. the dependence on the direction of the external field in relation to the tape surface, has to be taken into account. The anisotropy of MgB2 tapes with mechanically alloyed (MA) precursor powder and different sheath materials which can be much higher than the intrinsic anisotropy is discussed. Furthermore tapes with pure and C doped MA-MgB2 precursor are compared. Tapes with a hard Fe-sheath and undoped precursor show a high extrinsic anisotropy of the critical current density which can be reduced considerably by carbon doping. A texture of the MgB2 phase in the tape filaments introduced by flat rolling was observed by synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Using this texture information the observed macroscopic I-c-anisotropy of the tapes can be explained by calculations based on the percolation model.",

A metallic glass is a metastable alloy, which lacks the symmetry typical for crystalline materials and at room temperature shows an amorphous liquid-like structure. Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) represent a class of amorphous alloys. The most notable property of BMGs is their ultrahigh (near theoretical) strength and hardness. Because the known BMGs usually miss tensile plasticity and thus exhibit catastrophic failure upon tension it is important to understand deformation mechanisms involved and thus improve their performance. This aricle analyzes the use of synchrotron radiation for evaluating the elastic-plastic response of such materials.",

Mossbauer spectroscopy and XRD confirm an amorphous nature of the melt-spun ribbons. Furthermore, Mossbauer spectroscopy reveals a significant change of magnetic state of the as-quenched precursors when substituting Fe by Co (x = 0.5). Analyzing a series of XRD patterns in a reciprocal space yields a thermal expansion of the amorphous alloys providing an insight about the thermally activated effects such as relaxation and crystallization.",

The components of the elastic strain tensor were determined from both the change of positions of first maximum of the structure factor in reciprocal space as well as from the maxima of the atomic pair correlation function in real space. The atomic scale strain agrees with the macroscopic strain values. The topological and chemical short-range order of the Cu-Zr glasses changes upon loading. The number density of Cu-Zr and Zr-Zr nearest neighbour atomic pair becomes oriented along the loading direction whereas the partial nearest neighbour distances are only weakly influenced.

Because many of known BMGs miss tensile plasticity and thus exhibit catastrophic failure upon tension it is of great importance to understand deformation mechanisms involved and thus improve their performance. Time-resolved in-situ x-ray diffraction experiments may nowadays be performed at high-brilliance synchrotron radiation sources for a variety of conditions. An example is provided, concerning mapping of the strain distribution in tensile stressed Zr-based BMG by in-situ hard x-ray diffraction.",

The experimental data were modeled simultaneously with the reverse Monte Carlo simulation method. The combination of these independent measurements together with the application of some plausible physical constraints allowed the separation of the partial pair correlation functions and the estimation of the coordination numbers. All analysis of the results revealed that Ag-Se/Te bonds are preferred to Ag-As ones. The chemically ordered structure of As2Se3 remains essentially intact in As34Se51Ag15, while for As34Te51Ag15 alloying with Ag results in an increase of As-As and Te-Te bonds.",

Additionally, the short-range order structure has been investigated by XRD using synchrotron radiation. The changes observed in the calorimetric behaviour cannot be quantified using conventional XRD. Small changes are, however, visible in the total structure factor S (Q) primarily in terms of amplitude of the oscillations, which tend to increase with increasing thermal treatment temperature. Real-space analysis of the pair distribution function suggests that the first coordination shell consists of three peaks, which can be modelled using Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, the synchrotron data also reveal changes in the local structure that occur during structural relaxation and early formation of nanocrystals at temperatures close to the experimentally determined crystallization temperature.

It is found that Al atoms almost homogeneously distribute around Cu and Zr atoms without segregation, causing the local environment around Cu and Zr atoms in Cu46Zr46Al8 bulk metallic glass different from that of the major competing phase of Cu10Zr7. Furthermore, the addition of Al not only increases the amount of icosahedronlike clusters but also makes them more homogeneous distribution, which can enhance the GFA by increasing the structural incompatibility with the competing crystalline phases.

The evolution of the saturation magnetization and the switching field after different thermal treatment was studied. Amorphous glass-coated microwires based on FeNi exhibit magnetic bistability even in the nanocrystalline state.

In tension the samples fracture at a lower stress, 1500 MPa, with no sign of yielding or plastic deformation. With no macroplasticity observed under tension, large differences in the elastic constants obtained from the strain tensor and from ultrasonic sound velocity measurements are revealed.

The origin of high glass-forming ability (GFA) of the Zr-(Cu,Ag)-Al alloy system has been investigated from the structural, thermodynamic and kinetic points of view. The high GFA of the Zr-(Cu,Ag)-Al system is attributed to denser local atomic packing and the smaller difference in Gibbs free energy between amorphous and crystalline phases. The thermal, mechanical and corrosion properties, as well as elastic constants for the newly developed Zr (Cu,Ag)-Al BMGs, are also presented. These newly developed Ni-free Zr-(Cu,Ag)-Al BMGs exhibit excellent combined properties: strong GFA, high strength, high compressive plasticity, cheap and non-toxic raw materials and biocompatible property, as compared with other BMGs, leading to their potential industrial applications.

    abstract = "The magnetic, mechanical or chemical properties of nanocrystalline materials strongly differ from the ones of their coarse-grained counterparts. Moreover, significant changes of the phase diagrams were already evidenced for nanostructured alloys. Thermal processing with or without applied pressure controls the microstructure development at the nanometer scale and thus essentially decides upon the final nanomaterial behaviour and properties. A common route for the synthesis of metallic nanomaterials is the devitrification of amorphous precursors obtained via non-equilibrium processing, e.g. by rapid solidification or high-energy ball-milling. Time-resolved in-situ X-ray diffraction experiments may nowadays be performed at high-brilliance synchrotron radiation sources for a variety of temperature-pressure conditions. The temperature-time evolution of the grain-size distribution and microstrain can be monitored in detail at specimen-relevant scales. Together with local information from electron microscopy and chemical analysis, in-situ X-ray experiments offer a complete set of tools for engineering of the microstructure in nanomaterials. The effect of individual processing steps can be distinguished clearly and further tuned. An example is provided, concerning the high-temperature microstructure development in Co-rich soft magnetic nanostructured alloys.",

Significant changes of the phase diagrams were also recently reported for various nanomaterials. Thermomechanical processing routes - with or without pressure application - employed to obtain bulk nanostructured solids from nanocrystalline powders control the microstructural features down to the nanoscale and thus determine the final nanomaterial properties. Modern in-situ X-ray diffraction experiments provide effective tools for the observation and engineering of the microstructure in nanomaterials. Time-resolved in-situ synchrotron radiation diffraction experiments were here used to monitor the evolution of the weighted column-length distributions and microstrain at specimen-relevant scales during heating of nanocrystalline HITPERM and NANOPERM alloys. Diffraction line profile analysis methods were applied to observe the grain growth kinetics in these Fe(Co)-Zr-B-Cu nanostructured alloys. The retention of their excellent soft magnetic properties in particular at high temperature depends on the ability to supress anomalous grain growth.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) using synchrotron radiation, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), vibrating sample magnetometery (VSM), and the Faraday magnetic balance experiments were used to characterize the materials. XRD and DSC show that the fraction of crystallized bcc-Fe gradually increases with the milling time. The VSM measurements confirm the structure observations showing that the saturation magnetization increases with the milling time as the fraction of crystallized bcc-Fe increases. After 12 h of milling, the powder sample exhibited a Curie temperature of the amorphous phase T-C(am), which is approximately 55 K higher compared to the as-quenched ribbon (T-C(am)=601 K). Thermomagnetic measurements of heat-treated ribbons suggest that such an increase in T-C(am) is not only due to temperature rises during the milling but may also be attributed to the combination of mechanical and thermal effects connected with the nature of milling.

Different types of alloys (FeCuNbZr, FeCuNbSiB, FeCoCuNbB, CoFeZrB and CoFeSiB) in the form of original amorphous and nanocrystalline ribbons were subjected to different external factors: different annealing atmospheres, mechanical stress (for example influence of ball-milling) and tensile stress. It will be shown that the Mossbauer spectrometry is a suitable tool for such studies because the measured spectral parameters are very sensitive to the changes in the vicinity of the probe Fe-57-nuclei and thus, this technique provides a wide variety of information about structural and magnetic behavior of Fe-containing materials.",

    abstract = "The melt-spun Co-and Fe-based amorphous alloys have been investigated extensively for applications in magnetic devices, which require magnetically soft materials. Although these alloys exhibit excellent soft magnetic properties, their thin sheet shape, which is a consequence of the low glass forming ability, limits significantly their engineering applications. A powder metallurgy is thus an alternative way of producing bulk and, at the same time, soft magnetic materials, having desired shape. In our case, Co56Fe16Zr8B20 and Co70.3Fe4.7Si10B15 amorphous ribbons have been ball-milled for a short time and subsequently compacted (by hot pressing) into disc-shaped specimens with the aim to achieve small values of resulting coercivity. This work is focused only on the first preparation step i.e. on structural and magnetic properties of ball-milled powders obtained by ball-milling of Co-based melt-spun ribbons at different conditions. Two different ways of milling were employed in order to obtain a powder form of the material: the ribbons were either continuously ball-milled for up to 12 hours or, after each half an hour of ball-milling, the vials were cooled in liquid nitrogen bath for half an hour. Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry were employed to compare and to present the differences between these two different ways of milling.",

A gradual increase of the nanocrystalline fcc-Co fraction, produced by ball milling, was detected.

    abstract = "The amorphous, nanocrystalline and polycrystalline ferromagnetic alloys are known as materials with excellent soft magnetic properties. These attractive magnetic properties are challenge for researchers to extend investigation of these materials with the aim to broaden their technical exploitation. The shape in which amorphous, nanocrystalline and polycrystalline materials are usually prepared, is in many cases not suitable shape for application, therefore it is logical to attempt to prepare such material in a more ``bulk{''} form, for example in the form of a cylinder or a ring, that would be more convenient for industrial applications. One of the ways to prepare material in bulk form is to compact the powder. There is rational assumption that the non-magnetostrictive alloys (amorphous Co-Fe-Si-B, nanocrystalline Fe-Nb-Cu-Si-B, and polycrystalline Ni-Fe) may be suitable for the preparation of bulk samples by high-pressure compression, because mechanical stress does not induce magnetic anisotropy in ferromagnetic material during preparation process. We observed that milling of ribbons prepared by rapid quenching method leads to the increase of coercivity, which is caused by the increase of the fraction of magnetization vector rotation in the magnetization processes (the fraction of domain wall motion decreases). After long milling the powder particles become single-domain and can be magnetized by the magnetization vector rotation only, exhibiting maximum value of coercivity. Consolidation of powder with high value of coercivity leads to the ``magnetic contact{''} between powder particles resulting in the decrease of coercivity to the value comparable with that for as-spun ribbons.",

The powders were consolidated by hot pressing into disc-shaped bulk specimens. The influence of the consolidation temperature on the magnetic properties of bulk samples was investigated. Optimized consolidation parameters allowed to obtain bulk glassy samples without significant crystallization. In contrast, the gradual devitrification of the Co-based bulk metallic glasses during consolidation leads to a giant increase in coercivity. The observed magnetic hardening is assumed to be due to pinning of domain walls by crystallites.

This value does not significantly changes up to 1300 hours of milling but further milling causes sharp decrease of the coercivity. Magnetization of the samples very slowly rises up to a value of about 900 kA/m for 700 hours of milling and then steeply decreases with the extension of the milling time.

    abstract = "We report the enhancement of fracture toughness and strength of a cobalt tantalum-based metallic glass thin film with increasing boron content. The improvement of the mechanical performance is attributed to the formation of a compositionally lamellar compared to uniform glass microstructure, which becomes thinner with increasing boron content as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. Compositional variations across the lamellar structure are revealed by atom probe tomography. Cobalt- and boron-rich regions alternate sequentially, whereas tantalum exhibits slight variations across the lamellae. Our results can be utilized in future design efforts for metallic glass thin films with outstanding mechanical performance. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
